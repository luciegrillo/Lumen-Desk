  <em>Lumen Desk is a desktop application conceived in Electron, designed as a personal and immersive digital environment. Its purpose is to simulate a minimalist micro-operating system, aimed at the cohesive and intuitive organization and manipulation of ideas, tasks, and visual content.</em>
</p>

## ✨ Planned Modules

The application's conceptual architecture involves the implementation of the following core components:

-   👤 **User Management** — An authentication and management system for multiple individual accounts.
-   🖼️ **Windowing System** — An interface based on movable, resizable, and closable windows, allowing for simultaneous interaction with multiple modules.
-   📂 **File Manager** — A mechanism for the organization and manipulation of documents and media in an integrated virtual space.
-   ✍️ **Advanced Text Editor** — An editor supporting typographic formatting, file attachments, and the insertion of structural elements such as tables and images.
-   ✅ **Task Manager** — A module for the creation, monitoring, and completion of to-do lists.
-   ⚙️ **Settings** — A centralized panel for aesthetic customization (themes, color palettes) and general application operational adjustments.

## 🎨 Design Principles & User Experience (UI/UX)

The user experience in Lumen Desk is guided by the following principles:

-   **Intuitive Design:** The interface should be immediately familiar, inspired by metaphors from well-known operating systems to minimize the learning curve.
-   **Fluidity:** All interactions, especially window manipulations (dragging, resizing, opening/closing), must be smooth and responsive, using animations (via Framer Motion) to provide clear visual feedback.
-   **Focus & Minimalism:** The design will be clean and distraction-free, allowing the user to concentrate on their tasks and ideas.
-   **Personalization:** Users will have the ability to adapt the workspace to their preferences, changing themes and colors to create a truly personal space.
